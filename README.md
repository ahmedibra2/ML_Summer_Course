# An Assorted Machine Learning Beginners Course

## Fully fucntional machine learning codes written in Python and Jupyter Notebooks that cover several aspects of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and image processing algorithms.

This is a course for those looking to start their journey with machine learning and how to implement its techniques with readily available instructions inside the codes. This course is divided into 7 modules that starts with some basic Python commands - required for the learner to proceed through the course - and ends with advanced image processing techniques. The modules are listed as follows:

* Module 1: Python Basic Syntax and Commands
* Module 2: Linear Regression and Neural Networks
* Module 3: Convolutional Neural Networks
* Module 4: Recurrent Neural Networks
* Module 5: Unsupervised Clustering with KMeans
* Module 6: Image Processing Techniques 
* Module 7: Machine Learning Application in Structural Engineering
