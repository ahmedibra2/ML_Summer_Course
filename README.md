## A Machine Learning Course for Starters

This is a course for those looking to start their journey with machine learning and to implement its techniques using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks**. The codes are fully functional and cover several aspects of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and image processing algorithms with readily available instructions and comments inside. This course is divided into 7 modules that start with some basic explanation of Python commands - required for the learner to proceed through the course - and end with some advanced techniques for image processing.

### Module 1: Python Basic Syntax and Commands

Introduces basic Python commands, variables, and syntax. Demonstrates some functionalities of *Numpy* library to perform mathematical operations and *Matplotlib* to plot figures and visualize results.

### Module 2: Linear Regression and Neural Networks

In the first notebook, we perform basic data analysis on the <ins>Diabetes Dataset</ins> using *Pandas* library and introduce main concepts of machine learning such as training and test sets and data scaling to train a linear regression model using *scikit-learn* package.

[Jupyter Notebook](Module2-NeuralNetworks/Module2-LinearRegression.ipynb)

In the second notebook, we create and train a fully connected neural network using *Pytorch* to classify handwritten digits from the <ins>MNIST Dataset</ins>.
